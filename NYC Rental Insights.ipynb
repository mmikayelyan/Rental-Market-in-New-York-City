    "## Project Background\n",
    "Pillow Palooza is a start-up focused on disrupting the traditional real estate market by offering short-term rental options for travelers. The company has seen a significant increase in demand for short-term rentals in New York City, but wants to better understand the market in order to optimize their business strategy. Pillow Palooza has collected data from various sources on Airbnb listings in New York City to gain insight into the market. The company now plans to analyze this data using its internal teams, in order to provide recommendations on how to maximize revenue and occupancy rates for their short-term rental properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will provide insights and recommendations to the Pillow Palloza team, which is responsible for leading growth and success in the short-term rental market in New York City.  \n",
    "Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:\n",
    "1. What are the most popular neighborhoods for short-term rentals in New York City?\n",
    "2. What is the average rental price for short-term rentals in New York City, and how does it vary by neighborhood and property type?\n",
    "3. What are the most commonly rented property types on Airbnb in New York City, and how does this vary by neighborhood?"

    "- Python will be utilized for data collection, cleaning, and analysis tasks. \n",
    "- The data will then be loaded into a PostgreSQL database for efficient storage and retrieval. We will leverage Jupyter Notebook to execute queries against the database and derive insights to address the business questions at hand. \n",
    "- Additionally, we will utilize Tableau for data visualization, enabling us to create informative and interactive visual representations of the analyzed data.   \n",

It also sets the foundation for the subsequent steps in the analysis, which will involve identifying trends in the NYC Airbnb market.

The final output will be stored in a suitable format for the further analysis.  \n",

    "## Step #2: Data Insights with SQL\n",
    "In this step, we will import our data to the PostgreSQL server and begin querying it to gain valuable insights for our business. To achieve this, we will divide the dataset into three separate datasets based on their logical relationships. This approach allows us to organize the data more efficiently and makes it easier to understand and maintain the data structure. Each table will represent a specific aspect of the dataset, enabling us to focus on relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting the data into multiple tables, we gain the flexibility to scale and optimize the storage and processing of each dataset independently. We can allocate resources based on the specific requirements of each table, leading to improved performance and scalability. Additionally, this division allows us to apply different access control policies based on the sensitivity and confidentiality of the data. We can ensure that only authorized users have access to specific datasets, enhancing data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, having separate datasets enables us to perform data updates, modifications, and maintenance operations more efficiently. We can focus on specific tables without affecting the entire dataset, simplifying troubleshooting, debugging, and making necessary changes when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, separating the dataset into multiple tables in SQL provides a more organized, efficient, and scalable approach to data management. It enhances data integrity, query performance, security, and simplifies data maintenance tasks."
